# What is grvl?

Grvl (pronounced gravel) is Antmicro's open source library for creating rich, modern, animated graphical user interfaces, developed for use on constrained devices like MCUs.

Grvl is designed to be portable, currently supporting standalone [Simple DirectMedia Layer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) (SDL) based applications and [Zephyr RTOS](https://zephyrproject.org/).

With its collection of built-in widgets, XML-based config and support for reconfiguration in runtime, grvl was created with ease of use for both designers and developers in mind.
